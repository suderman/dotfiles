Local configuration and scripts
===============================

What's this?
------------

This is my collection of scripts and configuration files for all of 
my systems, including OS X and Ubuntu. 

I keep my dotfiles symlinked from ~/.local/dotfiles to my home directory. I
use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage them nicely.  

Installation
------------

If you're me, open a terminal and run this command:  
`bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suderman/local/master/bin/init)`
